{"instr":"# **_Step 2_**\n## Git add\nTo save or commit files to your Git repository, you first need to add them to the staging area.\n**_Git_** has three areas: the working directory, the preparation area, and the repository itself.\n Users move changes from the working directory to the staging area before making them to the repository.\n\nOne of the key approaches in **_Git_** is that commits are focused, small, and frequent.\nThe staging area helps support this workflow, allowing you to promote only certain files at a time instead of all changes to the working directory.\n\n**_Task_** \n======\nLet's create a file called **_Hello-Git.txt_**\nTo do this, use:\n```Bash\ntouch <folder> / <file>\n```\nNow add our file:\n\n``` Bash\ngit -C <directory> add *.txt\n```\n> \\\nIf you make an additional change after adding the file to the staging area,\n> then this change will not be reflected until you add the file again."}
