{"descriptionOfCourse": " ##  GitVC\n  \n  This course contains three parts that will allow you to learn the basics of working with git:\n\n  #Committing Changes\n  \n  In this scenario, we will answer questions such as:\n   * How to view changes in the working directory?\n   \n   * How to commit changes to your repository?\n  #Using Branches\n  \n  Here you will learn how to create branches in your repository.\n  The branch allows you to work effectively in a completely new working directory.\n  As a result, in one repository **_Git_** there may be several different versions of the code base,\n  each of which can be switched without changing directories.\n  \n  #Committing Files\n  The default branch in **_Git_** is called ``master``. Additional branches allow you to perform the same operations and commands,\n  as on the master, such as committing, merging, and submitting changes.\n  Since additional branches work just like master, they are ideal for prototyping and\n   experiments, as any changes can be combined with master if necessary!"}
